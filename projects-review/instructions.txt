1)  Simplify the list of managed hosts in the /home/student/projects-review/playbook.yml playbook by using a wildcard host pattern.



2) Restructure the playbook so that the first three tasks in the playbook are kept in an external task file located at tasks/web_tasks.yml. Use the import_tasks feature to incorporate this task file into the playbook.



3) Restructure the playbook so that the fourth, fifth, and sixth tasks in the playbook are kept in an external task file located at tasks/firewall_tasks.yml. Use the import_tasks feature to incorporate this task file into the playbook.




4) There is some duplication of tasks between the tasks/web_tasks.yml and tasks/firewall_tasks.yml files. Move the tasks that install packages and enable services into a new file named tasks/install_and_enable.yml and update them to use variables. Replace the original tasks with import_tasks statements, passing in appropriate variable values.



5) Verify the changes to the playbook.yml playbook were correctly made and then execute the playbook.
